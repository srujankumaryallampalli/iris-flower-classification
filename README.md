#  Iris Flower Classification

A machine learning project to classify Iris flowers into three species â€” *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* â€” based on the dimensions of their petals and sepals. This project uses various classification algorithms and evaluates their performance to determine the most accurate model.

##  Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Iris Flower Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)

- **Description**: The dataset contains 150 records under 5 attributes:
  - Sepal Length (cm)
  - Sepal Width (cm)
  - Petal Length (cm)
  - Petal Width (cm)
  - Species (Target label)

---

##  Project Goals

- Develop classification models to identify Iris flower species.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize patterns.
- Identify key features that influence classification accuracy.
- Evaluate and compare multiple ML models using performance metrics.

##  Algorithms Used

This project compares the performance of five different classifiers:

| Model                   | Accuracy |
|------------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression     | 95.56%   |
| K-Nearest Neighbors     | 95.56%   |
| Support Vector Machine  | 95.56%   |
| Decision Tree           | 93.33%   |
| Random Forest           | 95.56%   |

 **Logistic Regression** was selected as the final model due to its high accuracy and interpretability.
